# Amazon Clone using React.js
## Amazon Shopping Website with User Authentication and Payment functionality.

This is a Full-Stack Web Application clone of the original Amazon shopping website built using React.js and Firebase.
### Link :- https://clone-e755c.web.app/

### How the app works :-
* ðŸ‘‰ The basic skeleton lies on the "React.js" framework and component handling & information flow is handled using "React Context API".
* ðŸ‘‰ The User Authentication and hosting is handled by "Firebase".
* ðŸ‘‰ The payment functionality is achieved using "Stripe" payments (in the payment page keeping typing 42 (sample number for testing) until end for checking this functionality).

**NOTE**:
* The payment functionality doesn't work on the hosted version as it requires the Firebase Blaze plan. So, if you want to check the functionality clone it on your system and follow the above instruction for payment.
* Don't use your original credit cards here.

### Technologies :-
* React.js
* Firebase (User Auth & Hosting)
* Stripe (Payments)
